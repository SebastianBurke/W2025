# Introduction 
Heritage's IAAA (HIA3) is a login service which provides authentication and authorization services for application, as well as user and role management within those applications.

# Users
The system involves the following roles & actors:
| Role                   | Description                                                                                                           |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **HIAAA Administrator**| The Overarching Admin responsible for overseeing HIAAA, having access to all applications and App Admins.             |
| **App Administrator**  | The Admin for an individual application that manages specific user roles and permissions with their designated app.   |
| **App Developer**      | Developers who work on the application registered on HIAAA, consuming the web service to set up authentication and authorization for end users. |
| **End Users**          | Users who access the applications managed by HIAAA, authenticate, and get assigned the proper roles.                 |
