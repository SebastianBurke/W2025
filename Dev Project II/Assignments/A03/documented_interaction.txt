While working on my test results for Assignment 3 in class, Chris approached me to follow up on my concerns about my Assignment 2 grade. I informed him that I had already submitted a formal grade review request and that, as far as I was concerned, the matter was to be paused pending further review. Despite this, he began offering a new explanation for the low mark—this time stating that my individual submission was not uploaded to Moodle. This was not mentioned in our prior discussion on April 11th.

I accepted his explanation but asked where this deduction was reflected in the rubric, since losing 52% of my grade over a file that was never presented (due to our team merging presentations) seems excessive, ridiculous, and unclear. At that point, he told me to "watch how I talk about his course." I felt this was uncalled for, and told him I was done with the conversation.

He continued standing close to my workspace and repeatedly asked me to come to his office to discuss further. I declined, but a few minutes later I got up to ask again where the rubric shows this individual PowerPoint allocation. In response, he said I was violating the classroom’s safe space rules. Frustrated, I told him he was being manipulative and sat back down. He warned me one final time, and the conversation ended there.

Shortly afterward, Richard pulled me aside to ask what was going on. I explained that I’ve been feeling targeted by Chris since returning from March break, and that this isn't the first time I’ve felt uncomfortable. I also mentioned that I hadn’t raised this earlier because I was willing to accept a lower grade like a 60 or 70—but I cannot accept a 48, especially when the explanation for the mark keeps shifting. I had also spoken to Sandra that same day about a separate issue, so I felt it made more sense to raise the grade concern with her at that time.

To summarize, I feel that:

The rationale for my grade is inconsistent and not clearly documented in the rubric.

Chris has been unnecessarily confrontational and dismissive during our interactions.

His continued presence near my workspace after I ended the discussion felt intrusive and aggravating.

I am requesting that any further discussions with Chris regarding this matter happen in a formal, moderated setting, and that my grade review proceed with transparency and fairness.

Thank you for your time and understanding.
